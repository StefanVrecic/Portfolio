export const desc1 = "'Tdronez.com' was my first WordPress site. Made for a client who offers drone videography services. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!";

export const desc2 = "'VekiniDesign.com' was my first WooCommerce site. It is a simple platform that allows the client to sell their products to inbound social media traffic. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!";

export const desc3 = "'Bug Squash' was my first full-stack project. (To play around with app, click 'view', then 'login' - you don't need to fill out a new user. You may need to refresh the app once if it doesn't load the first time - this is due to a host setting). Built with MERN stack, it was primarily made to improve my skills using React, setting up databases and utilising authentication. Intended to track bugs, I opted for a simple Trello-inspired design. A cool feature is that the user is able to set deadlines for each task, and custom reminders. I integrated an email API - the backend will check every minute to see if there are any reminders upcoming, and email the user - if they so wish. There is also a 'deadlines' modal which allows for easy viewing of the most urgent tasks. I opted for a simple UI design as the main purpose was to work on my development skills. As I was building the app, I even used it to track it's own development by creating cards to track issue and adding notes. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!";
