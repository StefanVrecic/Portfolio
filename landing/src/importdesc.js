export const desc1 = <div><u><a href={link1}>Tdronez.com</a></u> was my first WordPress site. Made for a client who offers drone videography services. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!</div>;

export const desc2 = <div><u><a href={link2}>VekiniDesign.com</a></u> was my first WooCommerce site. It is a simple platform that allows the client to sell their products to inbound social media traffic. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!</div>;

export const desc3 = <div><u><a href={link3}>Bug Squash</a></u> was my first full-stack project built with <b>React and Node</b>. (To play around with app, click 'view', then 'login' - you don't need to fill out a new user. You may need to refresh the app once if it doesn't load the first time - this is due to a host setting). It was primarily made to improve my skills using React, setting up databases and utilising authentication. Intended to track bugs, I opted for a simple Trello-inspired design. A cool feature is that the user is able to set deadlines for each task, and custom reminders. I integrated an email API - the backend will check every minute to see if there are any reminders upcoming, and email the user - if they so wish. There is also a 'deadlines' modal which allows for easy viewing of the most urgent tasks. I opted for a simple UI design as the main purpose was to work on my development skills. As I was building the app, I even used it to track it's own development by creating cards to track issue and adding notes. Mobile, tablet & desktop friendly!</div>;

export const desc4 = <div><u><a href={link4}>Chrome-wiki</a></u> is a small <b>Chrome extension</b> that brings the Wikipedia summary preview directly to Chrome. This uses the <u><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Page_Previews/API_Specification">Page Previews API</a></u>. Ideal for curious individuals, English learners and students. The user only needs to highlight a phrase and right click, then select the new preview option added to the right-click menu. Chrome-wiki will display a small container with a summary and a small image if one is provided.</div>;
